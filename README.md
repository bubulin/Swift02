# Swift02 WWDC Session Transcripts

As used by [XXX](http://asciiwwdc.com).

## Methodology

Transcripts for WWDC sessions are aggregated from subtitles included in session videos from 2010, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

The code used to automatically scrape and collect this information for 2014 sessions is as follows:

```swift
var i01:Int = 10
```

Additional transcripts for 2012 WWDC content was graciously contributed by [Rev.com](http://www.rev.com/), and [community volunteers](https://github.com/mattt/wwdc-session-transcripts/graphs/contributors).
